# Module 18 - Build a blockchain-based ledger system

## Overview of the Application

The purpose of this blockchain exercise is to create a blockchain-based shared ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.


## Usage of the Application

To use the application, the user must enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click "Add Block" button. Clicking on "Add Block" button will store the block in the ledger.
